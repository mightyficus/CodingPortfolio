    <h3>Student Research Intern</h3>
    <p>
        Innovabio Research - Orem, UT<br>
        April 2019 to January 2020
    </p>
    <p>
        The amyloid precursor protein (APP) produces the Abeta peptides that are thought to cause
        Alzheimer’s disease by killing neurons in the brain. A less-studied hypothesis is that another product
        of APP called sAPPa, actually protects neurons; however, there are far fewer publications describing
        these effects, and none that fully explains how sAPPa protects cells. We have rudimentary evidence
        that sAPPa interacts with another protein. InnovaBio interns will work to verify that this interaction
        actually occurs in cells by: molecular production of protein fragments; using these protein fragments
        in biochemical tests to determine whether the protein fragments bind to each other; and finally,
        by introducing the red fluorescent tagged and green fluorescent-tagged proteins to live cells, and
        visualize whether the proteins are in the same space (red + green = orange). If the interaction is
        confirmed by the experiments, InnovaBio interns will then test in cultured cells whether this interaction
        with sAPPa functions to stabilize cells and protect them from dying.
